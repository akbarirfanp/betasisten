# Betasisten
Betasisten is a web-based application built using Laravel 8, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. The project was developed during my internship at CV Bisma Cipta Solusi, where I contributed to creating an efficient and user-friendly tool to assist school treasurers in managing financial tasks effectively.
